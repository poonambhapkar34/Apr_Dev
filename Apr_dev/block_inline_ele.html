<!-- A block-level element always starts on a new line, 
and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>. -->

<!-- Inline Elements
An inline element does not start on a new line.
An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary. 
e.g span,b,i etc -->

    <div>
        poonam
    </div>
    <p>para</p>
    <b>bolt.. bolt</b>
    <i>popopopopopo</i>
    <span>spannnnnnn</span>
    <div>pppppp</div>
